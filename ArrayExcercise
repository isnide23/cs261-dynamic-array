# When do I use an array?
# Here's one programming situation where your intuition should lead
# you to reach for an array. (In this situation, we'll use a Python list, which is a dynamic array.)

fruit1 = 'Apple'
fruit2 = 'Banana'
fruit3 = 'Cherry'
fruit4 = 'Donut'
fruit5 = 'Elderberry'
fruit6 = 'Fig'
fruit7 = 'Grape'
fruit8 = 'Honeydew Melon'
fruit9 = 'Ice Cream'

print(fruit1)
print(fruit2)
print(fruit3)
print(fruit4)
print(fruit5)
print(fruit6)
print(fruit7)
print(fruit8)
print(fruit9)

# Refactor this code using a Python list. Your program should
# exhibit the same behavior as above, but with far less code.














# For an extra challenge, use a numpy ndarray, which is a true
# static array.
